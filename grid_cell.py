# Grid Cell Oscillatory Interference Model v0.1
# Code: Zachary Hutchinson (zax) Feb 2020
# Email: zachary.s.hutchinson@maine.edu
#  
# Based on:
# The following grid cell model is based on the versions of an equation found in:
#   - Acker et al 2019 "Stable memory and computation in randomly rewiring neural networks"
# and
#   - Blair el at 2007: "Scale-invariant memory representations emerge from moir√© interference 
#   between grid fields that produce theta oscillations: a computational model"
#
# The constants employed are also from Acker2019 (which I believe are also Blair's).
#
# NOTE:
#   For the Acker equation: initial tests indicated that the distance between grid cell 
#   peaks was too small for a given value of lambda (in cm). Referring back to the Blair 
#   paper suggested a correction.
#
#   The Acker paper has: (4pi / sqrt(3l))
#   The Blair paper suggests: (4pi / sqrt(3)) / l
#
#   The Blair version seems to produce grid cell patterns with the correct lambda.
#
#   GridCell_Corrected is based on the Blair paper
#   GridCell_Acker is based on the Acker paper
